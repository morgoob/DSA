# Programming Assignment 1: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Programming Assignment 1 for the Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms course by Morgan Lloyd (moclloyd@ucsc.edu).

## Files Submitted

- `List.h`: Header file for the List ADT. Included in `List.c`, `Lex.c`, and `ListClient.c`. Written by me.

- `List.c`: Implementation file for the List ADT. Written by me. Some areas were referenced from the `Queue.c` example.

- `ListClient.c`: Test client for the List ADT. Provided on the class webpage. Unaltered.

- `Lex.c`: Client module for the List ADT. Written by me. Some areas were referenced from the `FileIO.c` example. Usage: `./Lex inputFile outputFile`.

- `Makefile`: Makefile for the assignment. Written by me. Usage:
  - `make`: Compiles `Lex`
  - `make ListClient`: Compiles `ListClient`
  - `make clean`: Removes all binaries
  - `make checkClient`: Checks `ListClient` for memory errors
  - `make checkLex`: Checks `Lex` for memory errors

- `in`: Example input file for `make checkLex`. Written by me.

## Usage

To compile `Lex` and `ListClient`:

```bash
make           # Compiles Lex
make ListClient  # Compiles ListClient
