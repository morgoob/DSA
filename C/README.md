# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects in C (2021)

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects developed in 2021, focusing on various data structures and algorithms concepts, all implemented in C.

## Projects

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)

This project demonstrates the Breadth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal.

### DFS (Depth-First Search)

This project showcases the Depth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal.

### LinkedList

Here, you'll find an implementation of a linked list data structure along with basic operations.

### Matrix

This project involves manipulation and operations on matrices, including multiplication and addition.

## Usage

Each project directory contains its corresponding C files and a Makefile. To explore and run a project, navigate to its directory and use the provided Makefile. For example:

```bash
cd BFS
make            # Compiles the project
./bfs            # Runs the compiled binary
