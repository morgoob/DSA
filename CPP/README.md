# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ (2021)

Welcome to my repository for Data Structures and Algorithms projects implemented in C++ in 2021. 

## Projects Included

### Dictionary ADT based on a Binary Search Tree

This project implements a Dictionary Abstract Data Type (ADT) using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The dictionary supports key-value pairs and provides efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of binary trees and efficient searching.

### Dictionary ADT Implementation Using Red-Black Tree

This project implements a Dictionary Abstract Data Type (ADT) using a Red-Black Tree data structure. This implementation provides key-value mappings with efficient operations backed by the principles of Red-Black trees. The Red-Black Tree-based dictionary includes concepts of balanced binary search trees and self-balancing techniques for maintaining optimal performance.



## LinkedList Implementation

This project showcases the implementation of a linked list data structure in C++. The linked list supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. It provides insights into how memory is managed dynamically and how nodes are linked.
