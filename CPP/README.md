# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ (2021)

Welcome to my repository for Data Structures and Algorithms projects implemented in C++ in the year 2021. This repository contains various projects related to data structures and algorithms concepts.

## Projects Included

### Dictionary ADT based on a Binary Search Tree

This project implements a Dictionary Abstract Data Type (ADT) using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The dictionary supports key-value pairs and provides efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of binary trees and efficient searching.

### Another Dictionary ADT based on a Hash Table

This project presents another implementation of a Dictionary ADT, this time utilizing a Hash Table data structure. The dictionary offers key-value mappings and utilizes hashing techniques for quick access to stored elements. It serves as an example of hash table concepts and collision resolution strategies.

## LinkedList Implementation

This project showcases the implementation of a linked list data structure in C++. The linked list supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. It provides insights into how memory is managed dynamically and how nodes are linked.

## Usage
