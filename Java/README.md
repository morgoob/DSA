# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects (2019)

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms projects implemented in Java. The projects cover a range of topics and concepts related to sorting, searching, linked lists, queues, hash tables, and more.

## Projects

### BucketSort

Implementation of the Bucket Sort algorithm for sorting elements.

### HashTable

Implementation of a basic hash table data structure.

### LinkedList

Implementation of various linked list operations and manipulations.

### QuickSort

Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm for efficient sorting.

### dataGenerator.java

A Java program to generate sample data for testing algorithms.

### IntMinHeap_PriorityQueue

Implementation of an Integer Min Heap data structure and a Priority Queue.

### Queue

Implementation of a basic queue data structure.

## Usage

Each project directory contains its respective Java files. You can navigate to a project directory and compile/run the Java files to see the implementation in action. For example:

```bash
cd BucketSort
javac BucketSort.java
java BucketSort
